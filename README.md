# Django Project Builder
Builds the skeleton files and directory structure for a basic Django Project, with a single app.

## CODING DOJO Folks
Just add this script just inside your Django Project's Directory. 

* FYI: It will only generate project's that are adjacent to the django_proj_builder dircectory.
